In today’s competitive job market, companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to automatically screen resumes before they reach human recruiters. 
Many qualified candidates get rejected because their resumes do not match job descriptions effectively.
This project aims to develop a Smart Resume Analyzer using Machine Learning that evaluates resumes against job descriptions and generates an ATS compatibility score.

The system extracts text from resumes and job descriptions, performs text preprocessing, identifies important skills and keywords, and calculates similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity techniques.
It also provides skill gap analysis, keyword suggestions, and suitable job role recommendations, helping candidates improve their resumes and increase their chances of getting shortlisted.
